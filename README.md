# F# #

## Setup

Install the required libraries by running the command below:

On Windows run

    build.cmd

On Mac run (Mono is required)

    ./build.sh

## Running (VSCode)

I use Visual Studio Code with the Ionide-Fsharp plugin. I load the code in FSharp Interactive (FSI).

You can also use FSI in Visual Studio.
